# The EveryBar ATM

### Description:
A simple ATM that can be found at most bars, and which you might end up using on a night out with your boys or girls. It accepts cash deposits, allows withdrawals (cash back) of up to the amount deposited, and charges exorbitant fees for invalid transactions. This project was an exercise in working with stateful React components, and a reminder to always carry cash on a night out. 

### How To Run: 
Run index.html. Select the mode of the ATM "Deposit" or "Cash Back". Select the amount desired, hit submit. The account balance will be updated according to the ATM mode selection and amount. You will not be able to withdraw more than is currently deposited in the account. 

### Potential Improvements:
- Transaction history
- Subtracting fees from the account balance
