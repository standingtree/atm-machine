# atm-machine

Description
A simple ATM, which accepts deposits and allows withdrawals (cash back) of up to the amount deposited. This project was an exercise in working with stateful React components. 

How To Run: Run index.html. Select the mode of the ATM "Deposit" or "Cash Back". Select the amount desired, hit submit. The account balance will be updated according to the ATM mode selection and amount. You will not be able to withdraw more than is currently deposited in the account. 

Potential Improvements:
- Transaction history
- Adding a Savings account with daily interest accruing
